# Problem 1:
# Write a method that prints out every number from 1 to 100.

# pseudocode
  # write a method
  # call the method
  # loop through something 100 times
  # print out the number from each iteration of the loop

# def one_to_one_hundred
#   index = 1
#   while index < 101
#     p index
#     index += 1
#   end
# end

def one_to_one_hundred
  index = 0
  while index < 100
    index += 1
    p index
  end
end

# one_to_one_hundred

# Problem 2:
# Write a method that prints out every other number from 1 to 100. (That is, 1, 3, 5, 7 â€¦ 99).

# pseudocode
# use the code from the previous question
# check if the number is divisible by 2

# Problem 3:
# Write a method that accepts an array of numbers as a parameter, and counts how many 55's there are in the array.

# make a method
# loop through all the elements
# check if each element is a '55'
# keep track of how many 55s there are

# p count_of_fifty_fives(my_input)

# Problem 4:
# Write a method that accepts an array of strings and returns a new array that has the string "awesomesauce" inserted between every string.
# For example, if the initial array is ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"], then the returned array should be ["a", "awesomesauce", "b", "awesomesauce", "c", "awesomesauce", "d", "awesomesauce", "e"].

# Problem 5:
# Start with the hash: item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2}
# Someone just bought two chairs. Change the hash such that the chair amount is 3.
# The final result should be: {chair: 3, table: 2}



# Problem 6:
# Start with the hash: item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2}
# You received 7 desks to sell. Change the hash to include desks.
# The final result should be: {chair: 5, table: 2, desk: 7}

item_amounts = {chair: 5, table: 2}
item_amounts[:desk] = 7

p item_amounts

# Problem 7:
# Write a method that accepts a number and returns its factorial.
# For example, the factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

# take the number and loop that many times
# decrement every iteration of the loop
# multiply all the numbers together

# p factorial(5)

# Problem 8:
# Write a method that accepts two arrays of numbers, and prints the sum of every combination of numbers from first and second array.
# For example, if the method receives [1, 5, 10] and [100, 500, 1000], the method should print a list: 101, 501, 1001, 105, 505, 1005, 110, 510, 1010].
